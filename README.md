# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Graph Algorithm Implementation in Java

Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for the shotest flights between airports.

The data of all airports and flights / routes between airports are taken from https://openflights.org/data.html

## Solution Highlights

The graph is represented using adjacency list and Java's priority queue is used to gather the shortest paths.

## Getting Started

Change the location of airport_file & flights_file in BaseData.java constructor to point to your local directory.
